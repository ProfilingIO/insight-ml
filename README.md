Java machine learning library.

## Example

```java
final int trees = 30; // number of trees to learn
final int maxDepth = 6; // maximum tree depth
final int minObs = 10; // min. observation in tree nodes
final double isample = 0.9; // sample fraction of data points per tree
final double fsample = 0.8; // sample fraction of features per tree
final VoteStrategy strategy = VoteStrategy.AVERAGE;

final RandomForest learner = new RandomForest(trees, maxDepth, minObs, isample, fsample, strategy);

// create your list of training data points here
final Collection<SimpleSample> trainingData = ...;
final IModel<ISample, Double> model = learner.run(trainingData);

// create your list of testing data points here
final Collection<ISample> test = ...;
final Double[] predictions = model.apply(new Samples<>(test));
```
